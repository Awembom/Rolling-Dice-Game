    when you chose the number of players, each player has
    a chance to roll the dice twice

# Elimination
    for each roll game: each players results in his 2 rolls is sumed
    the player with the minimun sum is immediately eliminated and the 
    rest continue playing

# conditions
    in case two or more players get the same sum total which is also the minimum
    as compared to the other players, a mini game is immediately
    set up between those  players, now the person who gets the least 
    after the game is eliminated
